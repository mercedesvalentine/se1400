        <p>The primary audience will most likely be between the ages of 30 and 40. This is because my website will be

        <h4>What will the gender be of the majority of your users?</h4>
        <p>The majority of most of the users will probably be female because I am a female artist and my website will
            most likely look pretty feminine. Because of this, my website will be appealing to female gender more than
            the male gender.</p>

        <p>The primary interest of my users will most likely be the interest of God's creations. This is because many of
