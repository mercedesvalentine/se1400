        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <h4>What types of content do competitors use on their websites?</h4>
        <p>The content on the art portfolio websites is mostly focused on showcasing the artist's artwork and
            introducing themselves.</p>
        <h4>What types of images are used?</h4>
        <p>All of the art portfolio websites use images of the art that they have created, and sometimes their website
            will have a picture of them.</p>
        <h4>What color schemes are used?</h4>
        <p>Most of the art portfolio websites use a soft color scheme so that the background doesn't take away from
            their artwork.</p>
        <h4>Layout styles and techniques used?</h4>
        <p>Most of the art portfolio websites use a clean layout with a lot of white space and a simple navigation bar
            at the top of the website. Some of the websites seem to use javascript or css to create interactive elements
            with a fun design.</p>
        <h4>What are some things visually I find appealing?</h4>
        <p>On one of the websites, I love how the creater used some of her artwork to create buttons/links to different
            pages on her website. I also love how most of the websites are clean around the artwork so the artwork is
            the focus and will pop out.</p>
        <h4>What are some things visually I find unappealing?</h4>
        <p>Most of the websites are almost completely white, besides the artwork itself, which is kind of boring or
            uninteresting to look at. I also don't like how some of the websites almost don't have anything to click on
            or that link to something else in their website.</p>
